# ðŸ‘• Cloth Size Verification
Cloth Size Verification is a **computer vision project** that leverages **UÂ²-Net (U2NETP)** and deep learning techniques to extract precise clothing outlines from images. This enables accurate **cloth size verification** for applications like e-commerce, fashion tech, and inventory management.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… **Clothing segmentation** using lightweight **U2NETP** model  
- âœ… **Image preprocessing & enhancement** for improved accuracy  
- âœ… **Training & testing scripts** for reproducibility  
- âœ… **Detection pipeline** to process new clothing images  
- âœ… Modular and extensible codebase (easy to adapt for other use cases)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TorchVision  
- **Supporting Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, tqdm
